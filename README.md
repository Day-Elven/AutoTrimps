## Script is Outdated, Please Update to the genBTC version.
<b>Message#2 from the AUTOTRIMPS Editor (genBTC):</b> You are currently using the zininzinin version. I have been designated the official maintainer of this branch for a while now (June), and have been running my own repository since April. The genBTC version is more current. The fact is that so much work goes into keeping both scripts seperated, and the zininzinin branch is currently months behind. Any work I do on the script will be going into the genBTC version. In a month or two, this branch will disappear completely, so please take this opportunity to try out your game on the genBTC branch now. It is slightly different but otherwise compatible.(look for new settings/tooltips, changelog is inaccurate,more work) <a href="http://genbtc.github.io/AutoTrimps/install.user.js">Install genBTC script into Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey</a> OR If you use the bookmarklet, replace the word zininzinin with genbtc in the URL. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Trimps/comments/5bimtg/psa_autotrimps_users_new_script_branch_zininzinin/"><b>REDDIT DISCUSSION THREAD</b></A><i> Hit either button to exit.</i>
